# Slip_to_Slip_connection

The Slips is a device used to grip and hold the upper part of a drill pipe to the drill floor, which is
the area where the pipe begins its trip into the earth. The Slips are used when making a
connection: the pipes are joined in order to advance further into the hole. Therefore, each pipe
is picked up by a hook, temporarily gripped by the slips and then joined to another pipe. After
the joint, the slips are removed and the entire pipe is carefully lowered into the hole, resuming
the drilling. The objective of this project was to built a model that could identify when the slips were on and off.
